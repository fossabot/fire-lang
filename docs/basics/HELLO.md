# Hello, world!

Fire is a simple language and has a very simple syntax. Each program contains the `main` function as in C.

There are two functions used to print: `print` and` println`.
Function `print` displays the given text, and `println` does the same, but additionally displays a newline.

The program below is "Hello, world" in the Fire language

```rust
fn main(argc: i64, argv: list) {
    println("Hello, world!");
}
```
